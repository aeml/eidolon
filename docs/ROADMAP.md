# Eidolon Engineering Roadmap

Last refreshed: September 5, 2026

This file is a short pointer. Current forward planning and historical closeout live in these documents:

- [`2026-09-05-v1-1-to-v1-10-roadmap.md`](plans/2026-09-05-v1-1-to-v1-10-roadmap.md) — proposed next releases and the immediate dungeon repair gate; reported exit, boss, ability, hallway, and floor defects must be resolved before 1.1 closes

- [`2026-04-18-alpha-1-0-roadmap-and-status.md`](plans/2026-04-18-alpha-1-0-roadmap-and-status.md) — completed release-line tracker from `0.35.0` through `Alpha 1.0`
- [`2026-05-03-v1-0-implementation-plan.md`](plans/2026-05-03-v1-0-implementation-plan.md) — audit-grounded implementation and closeout record

Per-patch detail lives in `index.html` Patch Notes.

## Why this file is short now

Earlier versions of this doc duplicated content with the top-level `ROADMAP.md` and with the active plan docs under `docs/plans/`. The duplication drifted: each refresh updated some files and missed others. The single-source-of-truth structure is now:

- `ROADMAP.md` (repo root): product roadmap and current release-confidence status
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` (this file): one-paragraph engineering roadmap pointer
- `docs/plans/2026-09-05-v1-1-to-v1-10-roadmap.md`: current forward roadmap and dungeon repair acceptance criteria
- `docs/plans/2026-04-18-alpha-1-0-roadmap-and-status.md`: historical Alpha release tracker
- `docs/plans/2026-05-03-v1-0-implementation-plan.md`: historical Alpha implementation record
- `index.html` Patch Notes: per-patch history
- `docs/plans/live-browser-qa-checklist.md`: durable local, deployment, and live-character release gate

For forward scope and newly reported dungeon defects, the September 5 plan takes precedence over historical closeout claims. Release implementation and live verification must be recorded separately.

## Architecture and review snapshots

For the architecture snapshot of `master` see [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md). For the review of what is working and what is fragile see [`REVIEW.md`](REVIEW.md). Those two docs cover the engineering context that used to live here.
